# üõ°Ô∏è Man-in-the-Middle Check Platform (MCP) üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## üåü Overview

Welcome to the Man-in-the-Middle Check Platform (MCP)! This project is designed to provide a robust solution for verifying user liveness. In an increasingly digital world, ensuring that interactions are with genuine, live users rather than bots or replay attacks is crucial. MCP achieves this by employing a combination of technical proof-of-life methods and data aggregation from diverse sources.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Technical Liveness Probes:** Implements various technical challenges to ascertain user liveness (e.g., CAPTCHAs, biometric prompts - *future feature*).
*   **Data-Driven Verification:** Aggregates and analyzes data from multiple trusted sources to build a comprehensive liveness profile.
*   **Flexible Integration:** Designed with APIs for easy integration into existing applications and workflows.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Allows for the addition of new liveness verification methods and data sources with ease.
*   **Security Focused:** Built with security best practices to protect sensitive data and ensure reliable verification.
*   **Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed logs for audit trails and debugging.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

*(Detailed installation instructions will be added here as the project evolves. For now, this is a conceptual outline.)*

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.8+
    *   Pip & Virtualenv
    *   [Other dependencies specific to data sources or technical probes]
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url/mcp.git
    cd mcp
    ```
3.  **Set up a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # This file will be created as project dependencies are added.
    ```
5.  **Configuration:**
    *   If a `.env.example` file exists, copy it to `.env`. This file will store your environment-specific configurations.
    *   Update `.env` (or create it if no example exists yet) with your API keys for different data sources and other necessary configurations as the project develops.

## üöÄ Usage

*(Usage examples and API documentation will be provided as the platform develops. Below is a high-level conceptual overview.)*

MCP will primarily be used as an API. Your application will make a request to the MCP API to verify a user's liveness.

**Example API Call (Conceptual):**

```python
import requests

mcp_api_url = "YOUR_MCP_API_ENDPOINT"
user_identifier = "user@example.com" # Or any other unique identifier
session_token = "USER_SESSION_TOKEN" # Token from the user's current session

payload = {
    "user_id": user_identifier,
    "session_token": session_token,
    # Potentially other contextual data
}

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_MCP_API_KEY"
}

try:
    response = requests.post(f"{mcp_api_url}/verify-liveness", json=payload, headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status() # Raises an exception for HTTP errors

    verification_result = response.json()

    if verification_result.get("is_live"):
        print(f"‚úÖ User {user_identifier} is verified as live.")
        print(f"Confidence Score: {verification_result.get('confidence_score')}")
    else:
        print(f"‚ùå User {user_identifier} could not be verified as live.")
        print(f"Reason: {verification_result.get('reason')}")

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"API Request Error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This project may contain components written in different languages. Here's a general guide:

*   **Go Components:** Located under `src/go/`.
    *   `mcp/`: Main Go module for the Man-in-the-Middle Check Platform.
        *   `cmd/mcp-server/`: Entry point for the MCP API server.
        *   `pkg/`: Internal packages used by the MCP application (e.g., `claude/` for Claude AI integration).

*(As other language components are added, they will be documented here.)*

## üìú License

*(The license for this project will be determined. For now, consider it proprietary unless otherwise stated.)*
